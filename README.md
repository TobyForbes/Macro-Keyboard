# Macro-Keyboard
Set this up by craeting a plain text file somewhere on your computer, then put the address for the file where it says "put address here" in the .lua and .ahk files

Then simply run the .lua file in lua macros (http://www.hidmacros.eu/)
And run the .ahk file in AutoHotKey (https://autohotkey.com/)
